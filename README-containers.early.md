See [https://github.com/AEADataEditor/docker-stata](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/docker-stata) for full instructions.


## Structure

The images are split into **versions**, **flavors**,  **editions** (types), and for versions greater than Stata 18, several **components**.

### Flavors

Stata version 18 and higher are available in the `regular` and the `now` flavors. The latter are denoted as `_5` in the image name, i.e., `stata18_5` for Stata Now 18. 

### Editions (types)

Stata comes in three editions: Basic Edition (`be`), Standard Edition (`se`), and MP-Parallel Edition (`mp`). While the typical Stata for Linux install will contain all three, the images here are split by type, each containing only one of the editions. 

### Versions

- The by-type images are available for Stata 18 and higher. For (monolithic) images for earlier versions of Stata 18 and below,
